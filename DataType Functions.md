**Range:**




**Characteristics:**

- Represents a sequence of numbers.

- Immutable.




**Features:**

- **Iteration:** Often used in loops to generate a sequence of numbers.

- **Memory Efficiency:** Consumes less memory compared to storing a list of numbers.

**Similarities and Differences:**




- **Common Methods:** Many data types share common methods like `len()` to get the length and iteration using loops.

- **Mutable vs. Immutable:** Lists, dictionaries, and sets are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creation. Strings, integers, booleans, tuples, and ranges are immutable.

- **Access by Index:** Lists, tuples, and strings allow accessing elements by index. Dictionaries and sets are accessed by keys.

- **Sequence vs. Mapping:** Lists, tuples, strings, and ranges are examples of sequences (ordered collections with indices). Dictionaries are mappings (key-value pairs), while sets are collections of unique, unordered elements.
