# Variables and Data Types:
# Variables are used to store data values in Python.
# Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more.


# Variable Naming Rules:
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
# Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.
# Variable names are case-sensitive.


# Variable Assignment:
# Use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable.
# Example: x = 10


# Dynamic Typing:
# Python is dynamically typed, meaning the data type of a variable can change during runtime.


# Naming Conventions:
# Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
# Follow conventions like CamelCase or snake_case, depending on context.


# Immutable vs. Mutable:
# Immutable data types (e.g., integers, strings) cannot be changed after creation.
# Mutable data types (e.g., lists, dictionaries) can be modified after creation.


# Variable Scope:
# Variables can have different scopes, such as local and global.
# Variables defined inside a function are usually local to that function.
# Global variables can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the code.


# Global Keyword:
# The global keyword is used to declare that a variable inside a function is global.


# Data Type Conversion (Type Casting):
# You can convert between different data types using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.


# String Formatting:
# Use string formatting to embed variables in strings for better readability.
# Example: name = "Alice"; print(f"Hello, {name}")


# Arithmetic Operations:
# Variables can participate in arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) depending on their data types.


# Comments:
# Add comments to your code using the # symbol to explain the purpose of variables and code segments.


# Printing Variables:
# Use the print() function to display the value of variables.
# Example: print(variable_name)


# Variable Reassignment:
# You can change the value of a variable by assigning it a new value.
# Example: x = 20


# Null and None:
# Use None to represent the absence of a value. It is Python's null-equivalent.


# Boolean Variables:
# Boolean variables can hold True or False values.
# Used for making logical decisions in code.


# Built-in Functions:
# Python provides built-in functions to work with variables, such as len(), type(), and str().

# Input from User:
# Use input() to take input from the user and store it in a variable.
# Example: name = input("Enter your name: ")


# Variable Interpolation:
# Besides f-strings, you can use methods like .format() to interpolate variables in strings.


# Variable Comparisons:
# Variables can be compared using comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) to produce boolean results.
