## OOPS CONCEPT IN PYTHON

1. **Classes and Objects:** Learn how to define classes as blueprints for objects and create instances of those classes.




2. **Attributes and Methods:** Understand attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that belong to a class and how to access them.




3. **Constructor (`__init__`):** Master the constructor method that initializes object attributes when an object is created.




4. **Inheritance:** Learn how to create a new class that inherits properties and methods from an existing class (base or parent class).




5. **Polymorphism:** Understand how different classes can share the same method name but implement it differently.




6. **Encapsulation:** Grasp the idea of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class) to control access.




7. **Abstraction:** Learn how to expose only relevant features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.




8. **Class Variables vs. Instance Variables:** Differentiate between variables shared by all instances of a class and those unique to each instance.




9. **Method Overriding:** Understand how to redefine a method in a subclass to customize its behavior.




10. **Super() Function:** Learn how to call a method from a parent class in a subclass using the `super()` function.




11. **Multiple Inheritance:** Get a basic understanding of inheriting from multiple parent classes.




12. **Dunder Methods (Magic Methods):** Explore special methods like `__str__`, `__len__`, and `__eq__` to customize object behavior.




13. **Composition:** Understand the concept of creating complex objects by combining simpler objects as components.




14. **Class Design Principles:** Learn about SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) for better class design.




15. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):** Get acquainted with creating abstract classes that can't be instantiated directly and provide a common interface.




16. **Class Attributes:** Understand attributes that belong to the class itself, rather than instances.




17. **Class Methods and Static Methods:** Learn the difference between methods that operate on the class and those that don't require access to instance-specific data.




18. **Method Chaining:** Explore how to design methods that return `self` to allow chaining multiple method calls.




19. **Namespace and Scope:** Understand the concept of namespaces and how they relate to classes and instances.




20. **Instance Initialization vs. Method Invocation:** Differentiate between the role of the `__init__` method and regular methods in an object's life cycle.
