**Strings:**




**Characteristics:**

1. A sequence of characters enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

2. Immutable: Once created, a string cannot be changed in place.




**Features:**

1. Concatenation: Combine strings using the `+` operator.

2. Indexing and Slicing: Access individual characters or substrings using indices.

3. String Methods: Built-in methods for operations like `upper()`, `lower()`, `split()`, etc.

4. Formatting: String formatting using `%` operator or f-strings.

**Sets:**




**Characteristics:**

1. Unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces.

2. Mutable: Elements can be added or removed.




**Features:**

1. Set Operations: Union, intersection, difference, etc., for mathematical set operations.

2. Set Methods: Built-in methods for adding, removing, and set operations.
