Here's a project structure divided into different files for both GUI and normal components:

**Project Structure:**

- `gui_app.py` (GUI application using Tkinter)
- `data_analysis.py` (Data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib)
- `machine_learning.py` (Machine learning using Scikit-learn)
- `README.md` (Project documentation)

Comprehensive Project
=====================

This project includes components for GUI programming, data analysis, and machine learning.

- `gui_app.py`: Run this file to launch the GUI application.
- `data_analysis.py`: Contains functions for data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- `machine_learning.py`: Contains functions for a simple machine learning task using Scikit-learn.

To get started, run the `gui_app.py` file and interact with the GUI. You can analyze data and run a simple machine learning model from the GUI.

Make sure to have the required libraries installed using:

```python 
pip install tkinter pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```


Please note that this example project is meant to be a starting point, and you can expand it by adding more features, improving code quality, and refining the components. It covers GUI programming, data analysis, and machine learning, as you requested.
