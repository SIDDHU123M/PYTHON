```python
# NumPy: Numerical Computing
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
mean = np.mean(arr)
std_dev = np.std(arr)

# Pandas: Data Manipulation and Analysis
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 22]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
mean_age = df["Age"].mean()

# Matplotlib: Data Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.show()

# Seaborn: Statistical Data Visualization
import seaborn as sns
