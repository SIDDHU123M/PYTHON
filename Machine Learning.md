**Machine Learning**

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Algorithms learn patterns from labeled data.
   - Regression predicts continuous values, classification predicts labels.
   - Example: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Algorithms find patterns in unlabeled data.
   - Clustering groups similar data points.
   - Example: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Agents learn to take actions in an environment to maximize rewards.
   - Q-learning is a classic algorithm for reinforcement learning.
   - Example: Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN).

**Notes and Tips:**
- Machine learning involves training models to learn patterns from data.
- Supervised learning uses labeled data to make predictions.
- Unsupervised learning discovers patterns without labels.
- Reinforcement learning teaches agents to make decisions for rewards.
- Practice is essential to understand and effectively use ML algorithms.

**Instructions:**
- Understand the fundamental concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- Explore machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- Choose appropriate algorithms for your specific task.
- Practice working with real-world datasets for hands-on experience.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Deepen your understanding of ML concepts through online courses and tutorials.

# Supervised Learning Example: Linear Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y = 2 * X + 3 + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
new_X = np.array([[5]])
predicted_y = model.predict(new_X)

# Unsupervised Learning Example: K-Means Clustering
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# Create and fit the model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
model.fit(X)

# Get cluster assignments
labels = model.labels_

# Reinforcement Learning Example: Q-Learning
